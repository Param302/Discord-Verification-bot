### About Pichavaram House

[Pichavaram House](https://sites.google.com/student.onlinedegree.iitm.ac.in/pichavaramhouse/home?authuser=0) is one of the 12 Official Houses of [IIT Madras BS Degree](https://study.iitm.ac.in/ds/).

Being the Web Administrator of Pichavaram House for 2023-24, I have created this bot.

## How to use

The bot is mainly used in #verify-here channel of Pichavaram House Discord server only.

### Application Commands

#### `/verify <email id>`

-   This command is used to verify the user.
-   It asks for the email id of the user.
-   And if it's a valid email id, it sends an OTP to the email id.

#### `/code <otp>`

-   This command is used to verify the OTP sent to the email id.
-   It asks for the OTP sent and checks if it's correct.
-   If it's correct, it gives the user the role of a verified user.
-   And other required roles such as:
-   -   If the user is of Pichavaram house, it gives the role of Pichavaram house and their respective group no.
-   -   If not, it gives Other House member role.
-   -   Apart from the above roles, it also gives their branch role (DS/ES). [DS - Data Science, ES - Electronic Systems] and their respective group no. role with the Group Leader role if they are.

#### `/reset`

-   This command is used to reset the verification.
-   If user entered wrong email id, or there's some typo and not able to receive the OTP, they can use this command to reset the verification process.
-   After reseting, they can verify again using the [`/verify`](#verify-email-id) command.

> It also logs each activity of the verification process in a log file as well as in a log channel.

### How it works

-   First it takes the email id of the user using the [`/verify`](#verify-email-id) command.
-   Then it parses the email id according to the format required.
-   If It's parses correctly, it sends an OTP to the email id.
-   If it's not, it asks to again enter the email id.
-   Then it asks for the OTP sent to the email id using the [`/code`](#code-otp) command.
-   If the OTP is correct, it gives the required roles to the user. Else it asks to enter the OTP again.
-   If the user wants to reset the verification process, they can use the [`/reset`](#reset) command.
-   It also logs each activity of the verification process in a log file and in a log channel.
-   For the multi-users verifying at same time, it handles the synchronization of the data as well.
